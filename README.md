# Diamant-FSharp
Diamant is a game of pushing your luck as you explore a cave complex littered with jems, and traps.
Each turn, the only decision you make is which of the two possible choices to take. You can stay in the cave, potentially acquiring more jems but also risking being caught by a trap.
Alternatively, you can call it a day and retreat to camp to bank your winnings, which keeps you safe but limits your winnings.

This repository contains FSharp code to model game of Diamant with players following simple rules to make their decisions. The aim
is to assess if some strategies are better than others.
